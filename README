ActiveScaffold batch is a gem which adds batch_update, batch_create and batch_destroy actions to ActiveScaffold, which means you can perform operations on more than just one record.

gem 'active_scaffold_batch'

It works with ActiveScaffold >= 3.4.18 and rails >= 4.0.
Use 3.3.x for rails 3.2.x.

In the config block of an activescaffold you can add any of the following lines:

    config.actions.add :batch_create
    config.actions.add :batch_update
    config.actions.add :batch_destroy
